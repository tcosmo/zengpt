# Confirm absence of remote code (2025-09-01 13:02Z)

_**User**_

Can you confirm we are not using any remote code?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Examining remote code usage**

I need to confirm if the project uses any remote code. This small Chrome extension includes files like manifest.json, content.js, and popup.html/js. I'll look for references to remote scripts, CDNs, and dynamic imports. Chrome extensions MV3 often disallow remote code. 

To proceed, I'll inspect content.js, popup.html/js, and manifest.json. Using functions like read_file and multi_tool_use.parallel will help read all relevant files efficiently while I check for common indicators like 'http' and 'fetch('. I'll also be providing status updates after tool usage.
**Scanning for remote code references**

I’ll include a quick update that I’m scanning the codebase for any remote code references. This involves checking for anything that might connect to external sources like scripts or imports. It's important to ensure the project adheres to Chrome extension guidelines. Let’s get started on this and see what we find! I’ll keep track of any notable findings during the scan and report back as needed.</details></think>

I'll scan the extension files for any references to remote scripts, remote imports, or dynamic code loading to confirm no remote code is used.

**Yes — no remote code is used.**

- **Scripts/CSS**: All loaded locally (`content.js`, `popup.js`, `styles.css`); no external `<script>` or `<link>` tags.
- **Network calls**: None found (`fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, websockets, dynamic `import()` not used).
- **Dynamic code**: No `eval`, `Function`, or remote script injection.
- **Assets**: Icons/images resolved via `chrome.runtime.getURL(...)` (`icon.png`, `zen.png`) — all local.
- **Permissions**: `host_permissions` are for matching pages only; no code fetch from those hosts.
- **External links**: Popup has regular hyperlinks to websites; they open in a new tab and do not load code into the extension.

If you want, I can also add an explicit comment in `README.md` noting “no remote code / no network requests.”
